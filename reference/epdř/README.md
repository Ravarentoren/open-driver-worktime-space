## 🧭 Relationship to ODWS

EPDŘ is an **external reference dataset**.

- ODWS defines **structure, rules, and semantics**
- EPDŘ provides **localized reference values**
- ODWS remains **jurisdiction-agnostic**
- EPDŘ remains **ODWS-independent**

---

🧠 **Design principle:**  
> _Reference data must never redefine normative truth._
