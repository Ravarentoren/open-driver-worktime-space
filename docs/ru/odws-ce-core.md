# ODWS-CE Core – Time and Inputs Foundations

This document normatively defines the **core foundations** of the
**Open Driver Worktime Space – Compensation Engine (ODWS-CE)**.

It describes **what the computation core is built upon**,
not how it is implemented, optimized, or presented to users.

The purpose of this document is to establish a **stable, non-negotiable base**
for all ODWS-CE implementations.

---

## Scope

This document normatively defines:

1. Time primitives used by ODWS-CE
2. The nature of inputs as representations of reality
3. The relationship between inputs, time, and conflicts

It explicitly does **not** define:

* wages or compensation rules
* legal compliance logic
* UI or UX behavior
* storage, synchronization, or networking

---

## 1. Time primitives

### 1.1 Time as a continuous axis

ODWS-CE operates on a **continuous time axis**.

Time is treated as:

* continuous
* linear
* monotonic

ODWS-CE does **not** operate on:

* calendar days
* workdays
* shifts
* scheduled blocks

Such concepts may exist only in **interpretation layers**, never in the core.

---

### 1.2 TimePoint

A **TimePoint** represents a single position on the time axis.

A TimePoint:

* has a precise timestamp
* is immutable once created
* is always associated with a source reference

TimePoints:

* do not imply meaning
* do not imply work
* do not imply responsibility

They only locate events in time.

---

### 1.3 TimeInterval

A **TimeInterval** represents a span between two TimePoints.

A TimeInterval:

* has a start TimePoint
* has an end TimePoint
* may include uncertainty or confidence metadata

TimeIntervals:

* may overlap
* may be fragmented
* may be incomplete

There is no requirement that intervals:

* align to days
* align to shifts
* align to contractual expectations

Reality takes precedence over structure.

---

## 2. Inputs as representations of reality

### 2.1 Nature of inputs

All inputs in ODWS-CE represent **claims about reality**.

An input:

* describes what allegedly happened
* does not assert correctness
* does not override other inputs

Inputs are **observations**, not truth.

---

### 2.2 Input records

Each input is represented as an **InputRecord**.

An InputRecord:

* references one or more TimeIntervals
* identifies its source
* records authorship and creation time

InputRecords are:

* immutable
* append-only

Once created, an input record:

* is never modified
* is never deleted
* may only be superseded by additional inputs

---

### 2.3 Types of input sources

ODWS-CE recognizes multiple classes of input sources, including but not limited to:

* automated devices (e.g. tachographs)
* human declarations
* derived records (e.g. spreadsheets, scans)
* corrective or explanatory inputs

No input source is inherently authoritative.

Authority is **never** implied by technology, position, or role.

---

## 3. Conflicts and coexistence of inputs

### 3.1 Conflicts are expected

Conflicts between inputs are a **normal property of reality**.

Conflicts may arise between:

* device and human input
* human and human input
* document and document

The presence of conflict:

* is not an error
* is not a failure
* does not invalidate the system

A conflict is **information**.

---

### 3.2 Conflict representation

Conflicts are explicitly represented within ODWS-CE.

A conflict:

* references the involved inputs
* identifies the overlapping or inconsistent intervals
* is traceable and inspectable

Conflicts are preserved throughout computation.

They are never silently resolved or discarded.

---

### 3.3 Protection against overwriting reality

ODWS-CE is designed to prevent replacement of reality by authority.

Therefore:

* no input can overwrite another input
* no role can erase previous records
* no computation step can hide conflicts

Any attempt to reinterpret reality:

* results in new inputs
* leaves the original records intact

This guarantees that:

* employee inputs remain visible
* historical reality remains reconstructible
* power asymmetry cannot silently rewrite time

---

## Normative summary

In ODWS-CE:

* time is continuous, not scheduled
* inputs describe reality, not authority
* conflicts are data, not defects
* overwriting reality is structurally impossible

All higher-level concepts
(wages, legality, compliance, reporting)
are built **on top of this foundation**,
never inside it.
