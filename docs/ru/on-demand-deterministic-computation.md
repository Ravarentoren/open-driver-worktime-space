# On-Demand Deterministic Computation

This document defines the principle of
on-demand deterministic computation
within the Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS).

It exists to ensure that critical information
is available when humans need it —
not only after administrative finalization.

---

## 1. Core Principle

> Deterministic computation MUST be available
> whenever sufficient factual input exists.

ODWS explicitly supports computation:
- before legal effectiveness,
- before administrative closure,
- before payroll finalization.

Computation availability
MUST NOT depend on formal completion of events.

---

## 2. Informational Nature

On-demand computation results are:

- informational,
- non-binding,
- subject to recomputation.

They exist to:
- inform decisions,
- prevent silent loss of entitlement,
- enable timely human action.

---

## 3. Separation from Legal Acts

ODWS strictly separates:

- factual inputs,
- deterministic computation,
- legal effectiveness,
- financial settlement.

A computed result does NOT:
- create legal obligation,
- finalize employment state,
- replace formal procedures.

---

## 4. Typical Use Cases

On-demand computation is essential when:

- termination is imminent,
- notice delivery is expected,
- employment end date is anticipated,
- vacation entitlement must be clarified quickly.

These situations often occur
minutes or hours before formal acts.

---

## 5. Normative Requirement

Any ODWS-compatible system MUST:

- allow on-demand computation,
- clearly label informational results,
- preserve recomputation capability,
- record all steps in the Deterministic Trace Log.

Refusal to compute based on timing alone
is incompatible with ODWS.
