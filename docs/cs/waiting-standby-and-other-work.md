# Waiting, Standby, and “Other Work”
## in the Profession of a Professional Driver

This document explains how ODWS understands the concepts of
waiting, standby, and other work
in the context of professional drivers.

The purpose of this document is **not** payroll or accounting classification,
but a description of reality as it actually exists.

---

## 1. Fundamental Principle of ODWS

ODWS is based on the following axiom:

> A driver’s working time is the sum of all activities
> performed between two daily rest periods.

A change in the nature of an activity
does not interrupt or terminate work.

---

## 2. The Workplace of a Professional Driver

The driver’s workplace includes:
- the vehicle,
- its immediate surroundings,
- loading and unloading locations,
- any place where the driver is required to be
  for the purpose of performing work.

During a shift, the driver remains
continuously in a working mode.

---

## 3. Waiting as an Integral Part of Work

Waiting in the driver’s profession typically includes:
- waiting for loading or unloading,
- waiting for documents,
- waiting for instructions,
- waiting in traffic congestion or road closures,
- waiting caused by operational reality.

During waiting, the driver:
- has no personal freedom,
- remains at the workplace,
- performs related activities
  (administration, planning, vehicle checks).

Waiting is not inactivity.

---

## 4. Why the Concept of “Standby” Does Not Reflect Reality

Standby, in general labor-law terminology, assumes:
- absence from the workplace,
- personal freedom,
- the ability to freely dispose of one’s time.

These conditions are **not** met
in the case of professional drivers.

Using the term “standby”
for activities performed by a driver at the workplace
is both linguistically and factually inaccurate.

---

## 5. “Other Work” According to Regulation (EC) 561/2006

Regulation (EC) 561/2006 distinguishes between:
- driving,
- other work,
- availability (standby),
- rest.

The term “other work” was introduced
as a **technical recording category**,
not as a reduction of the value of work.

In practice, it includes:
- administrative tasks,
- communication,
- maintenance,
- planning,
- supervision of the vehicle and cargo.

---

## 6. Road Safety Considerations

Artificially excluding waiting from working time:
- distorts real fatigue levels,
- shortens actual rest,
- endangers road safety.

ODWS considers safety
to be superior to accounting constructs.

---

## 7. ODWS Position

ODWS adopts the following definition:

> The work of a professional driver includes all activities
> performed within their working time.

In professional transport, working time
means **all time between two daily rest periods**.

Working time therefore also includes:
- safety breaks,
- short mandatory breaks,
- other breaks resulting from safety and health requirements.

These breaks:
- are not the driver’s free choice,
- are a mandatory part of work performance,
- represent a natural necessity to maintain road safety.

With this approach, ODWS:
- separates accounting and administrative terminology
  from the terminology of professional drivers,
- describes the driver’s work as a continuous whole without fiction,
- captures work reality as it truly occurs.

Because ODWS prioritizes alignment between:
- the reality of work performance,
- the applicable legal framework,
- the actual workplace of professional drivers,
- payroll and administrative processing,
- humans and technical systems,
- and humans among themselves,

this text is formulated and maintained in this manner.

## 8. Relationship to Other ODWS Documents

This document is conceptually linked to:
- `workday.md`
- `operational-realities.md`
- `human-context.md`

Its purpose is to explain the conceptual foundation,
not to perform calculations.
