# Vacation Planning and Intent

This document defines vacation planning
as a human-declared intent.

---

## 1. Purpose

Vacation planning:
- is not binding computation,
- is not payroll data,
- is not a legal act.

It is a communication tool.

---

## 2. Planning Records

Planning MAY include:
- desired dates,
- priority indicators,
- notes and constraints.

---

## 3. Separation from Entitlement

Planning:
- does not consume entitlement,
- does not modify computation,
- may differ from final usage.

---

## 4. Human-Centered Design

ODWS treats planning as:
- a declaration of intent,
- a coordination signal,
- a trust-based input.

No automatic enforcement applies.
