# Records as a Source of Operational Paradoxes
## Descriptive Document

This document **describes real-world paradoxes arising from the recording of professional drivers’ work**.

It is **not a legal interpretation** and **not a normative specification**.  
Its purpose is to **name the gap between work reality, technical recording capabilities, and administrative expectations**.

---

## 1. A Record Is Not Reality

In practice, it is often implicitly assumed that:

> “What is recorded is reality.”

This assumption is false.

A record:
- is a **trace of reality**, not reality itself,
- is created **under specific technical and organizational conditions**,
- may be:
  - incomplete,
  - delayed,
  - conflicting,
  - technically constrained.

Driver work reality **exists even outside moments when a technical device is available**.

---

## 2. Tachograph as a Limited Recording Source

A digital tachograph:
- is permanently bound to a specific vehicle,
- records only what happens **within that technical configuration**,
- is not available:
  - during multimodal transport,
  - during movement outside the vehicle,
  - between employments,
  - while waiting for vehicle assignment,
  - during towing or transport on a low-loader.

Despite this, it is often treated as **the only legitimate source of reality**.

---

## 3. The Manual Entry Paradox

In real practice, a contradiction arises:

- manual entry is **required**,
- but technically:
  - it cannot be made without access to the tachograph,
  - it cannot be made in real time,
  - it cannot contain future timestamps.

Manual entry is always:
- **delayed**,
- **reconstructive**,
- **dependent on memory and context**.

This is not a driver failure, but a **system property**.

---

## 4. Conflicting Records and Error 80

In certain situations (e.g. multimodal transport by train or ship), the following occur:
- movement conflicts,
- error reports (e.g. tachograph error 80).

These conflicts:
- do not arise from fraud,
- arise from **a mismatch between real movement and the technical model of the device**,
- are a normal part of reality.

They are especially frequent during:
- border crossings,
- combination of multiple transport modes,
- time shifts between reality and manual input.

---

## 5. Transfer of Responsibility to the Driver

In many cases, responsibility is silently shifted:

- the employer demands complete records,
- accounting systems expect continuous data,
- the device had no technical ability to create the record,
- responsibility is placed on the driver.

As a result, the driver is forced to:
- explain missing records,
- defend a reality that could not be technically recorded,
- bear consequences of a systemic contradiction.

---

## 6. Absence of a Shared Reality Model

Between the involved parties, there is no:
- shared model of reality,
- common language,
- agreement on what constitutes a record versus reality.

The result is:
- misunderstanding,
- distrust,
- pressure to “fill things correctly” instead of understanding reality.

---

## 7. Relation to ODWS

ODWS:
- does not deny technical records,
- but **refuses to elevate them to authorities over reality**.

This document explains
why it is necessary to:
- separate reality from recording,
- work with conflicts,
- allow multiple sources of reality description.

---

## 8. Summary

- A record is not reality.
- Technical devices have limits.
- Manual entry is necessarily delayed.
- Record conflicts are normal.
- The driver is not the source of systemic paradoxes.

These paradoxes are not individual failures,
but consequences of **misalignment between reality, technology, and administration**.
