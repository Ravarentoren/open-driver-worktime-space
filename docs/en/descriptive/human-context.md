# Human and Local Context Principles

ODWS is built on the understanding that work is performed by people,
not by abstract entities.

Professional drivers do not operate in a vacuum.
They live, work, and build their lives within specific countries,
cultures, and social environments.

This project recognizes that human dignity, local identity,
and a sense of belonging are essential components of sustainable work.

## 1. Respect for Human Reality

ODWS is designed with the awareness that:
- people work under stress
- people make mistakes
- people are not machines

Human imperfection is not a failure of the system.
It is a fundamental property of reality.

Systems must adapt to people — not force people to adapt to systems.

---

## 2. Respect for Local Context

ODWS respects the fact that work is performed:
- within specific national territories
- under local legal, social, and cultural conditions

Local context is treated as a factual attribute of work,
not as an ideological statement.

Recognizing where work is performed is not nationalism.
It is acknowledgment of reality.

## 3. Neutrality Without Alienation

ODWS deliberately avoids embedding political or ideological narratives.

At the same time, it avoids alienating the people whose work it models.

The project aims to be:
- technically neutral
- culturally respectful
- locally interpretable

---

## 4. Pride Without Exclusion

People have a natural need to feel that their work:
- is meaningful
- is respected
- belongs somewhere

ODWS allows this sense of belonging without excluding others.

No country, group, or perspective is privileged.
All are respected equally through the same transparent model.

## 5. Core Principle

> ODWS respects local human context without embedding ideology.

This principle guides both the specification
and all future implementations built upon it.
