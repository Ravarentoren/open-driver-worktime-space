# Project Vision

Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS) was created
in response to a long-term mismatch between
the real work performed by drivers
and the way this work is recorded and evaluated.

The project is not a political instrument
and not a commercial product.

It exists as an **open technical foundation**
intended to enable a truthful
and reviewable description of work reality.

---

## 1. Core Idea

ODWS is based on a simple assumption:

- work exists before its interpretation
- data exists before decisions
- computation must be separated from power

The goal of the project is to create a system
that allows work to be **calculated and explained**
without enforcing a single correct conclusion.

---

## 2. Neutrality and Openness

ODWS does not seek authority.

The project:
- does not replace human decision-making
- does not replace law
- does not replace negotiation

Instead, it provides:
- an open computational model
- transparent rules
- reproducible results

---

## 3. Long-Term Goal

The long-term goal of ODWS is not dominance,
but **usability across generations**.

The project is designed to be:
- portable
- transferable
- sustainable without dependency on individuals

Success is not measured by popularity,
but by the fact that the system can be used
without knowledge of its original authors.

---

## 4. Relationship to Reality

ODWS is designed with the awareness
that reality is incomplete, variable,
and sometimes contradictory.

The project therefore:
- acknowledges uncertainty
- allows multiple interpretations
- does not sell false certainty

This restraint is intentional
and is considered one of the core values
of the project.
