# Physical and Technical Limits of Recording Devices

## Normative Definition of Reality, Devices, and Their Relationship

This document **normatively defines the physical and technical limits**
of recording devices used in road transport,
in particular digital tachographs and driver cards.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent the confusion of devices with reality,
- define responsibility boundaries of technical systems,
- protect real work from false technical assumptions.

---

## 1. Physical Nature of Devices

Normatively:

- a digital tachograph is a **physical technical device**
- a driver card is a **physical identity carrier**
- both entities:
  - exist materially,
  - are composed of physical components,
  - are subject to the laws of physical reality

These limitations **cannot be overridden**
by legal interpretation, administrative demand,
or employer policy.

---

## 2. Binding of Tachograph to a Vehicle

Normatively:

- a tachograph is **exclusively bound to a single specific vehicle**
- a tachograph **cannot record reality outside that vehicle**
- a tachograph **does not exist independently of the vehicle**

Therefore:

- reality occurring outside the vehicle
  **cannot be recorded by the tachograph**
- absence of a record **is not evidence of absence of reality**

---

## 3. Binding of Driver Card to a Person

Normatively:

- a driver card is **bound to one specific individual**
- the card itself **does not record reality**
- the card functions **only in combination with a compatible device**

Therefore:

- without physical access to a tachograph,
  **technical records cannot be created**
- reality occurring without device access
  **cannot be recorded in real time**

---

## 4. Technical Configuration Is Not Reality

The combination of:
- person
- driver card
- tachograph
- vehicle

constitutes a **technical configuration**, not reality itself.

Normatively:

- technical configuration **limits recording capability**
- technical configuration **does not define truth**
- reality **does not cease outside the configuration**

---

## 5. Inevitable Technical Blind Spots

Due to physical and technical constraints,
**inevitable blind spots of recording exist**, including:

- work performed outside a vehicle
- transfers between vehicles
- multimodal transport (train, ship, aircraft)
- waiting without access to a tachograph
- administrative and organizational tasks
- periods between employment relationships

These blind spots:
- are **not violations**
- are **not driver failures**
- are direct consequences of device design

---

## 6. Fundamental Separation of Reality and Record

Normatively:

- **reality exists independently of devices**
- devices record **only a subset of reality**
- unrecorded reality **does not lose validity**
- records **are not superior to reality**

Devices are signal sources,
not carriers of truth.

---

## 7. Relation to ODWS-CE Core

For these reasons, the ODWS-CE core:

- grants no implicit authority to any device,
- separates reality from technical recording,
- allows representation of reality:
  - recorded with delay,
  - recorded manually,
  - recorded outside devices

The goal is not to deny technical records,
but to **protect reality from their limits**.

---

## 8. Normative Summary

- a tachograph is a physical device with physical limits
- a driver card is a physical identity carrier
- driver reality is not constrained by these limits
- absence of record is not absence of reality

If a device does not record reality,
**ODWS does not invent it**.

If reality exists,
**ODWS does not deny it**.
