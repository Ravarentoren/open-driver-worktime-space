# ODWS Normative Position  
## On Worktime Funds and Temporal Reality

---

## Normative Rule: Temporal Reality Precedes Averaging Constructs

**ODWS defines recorded working time exclusively as working time that actually occurred on specific calendar days.**

Any form of averaging, smoothing, or so-called *worktime fund* construct  
(including weekly or settlement-period worktime funds)  
**MUST NOT** be part of the ODWS normative reference layer.

---

## Normative Rationale

1. **Worktime funds are planning constructs**, not records of reality.  
2. **Normative worktime records MUST preserve temporal locality**, including:
   - the specific calendar day,
   - the type of day (working day, weekend, public holiday),
   - time-of-day attributes (e.g. night work).
3. Any mechanism that redistributes worktime across days  
   **alters the economic and legal meaning** of the recorded time.

---

## Normative Prohibition

**ODWS SHALL NOT normalize, average, or offset working time across calendar days**  
in any manner that:

- suppresses the emergence of daily overtime,
- dilutes or obscures weekend or public holiday work,
- or retroactively reclassifies working time based on later periods.

This prohibition applies **regardless of**:
- the length of the settlement period,
- employer scheduling practices,
- or payroll optimization strategies.

---

## Separation of Layers (Normative Rule)

**ODWS strictly separates:**

- the **Reference Layer** – what actually occurred (time, day, context),
- the **Interpretation Layer** – legal, contractual, or payroll decisions.

Fund-based calculations, if used at all,  
**BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO THE INTERPRETATION LAYER**  
and **MUST NEVER MODIFY REFERENCE-LAYER DATA**.

---

## Employee Economic Neutrality Principle (Normative)

Any computational construct included in the reference layer  
**MUST be economically neutral with respect to the employee**.

Constructs that systematically transfer value, risk, or compensation  
away from the employee  
**ARE NOT PERMITTED** in the ODWS reference model.

---

## Normative Summary

- Worktime funds are not prohibited in general.  
- **They are prohibited as truth.**  
- They may exist only as interpretation.  
- Temporal reality remains **inviolable**.
