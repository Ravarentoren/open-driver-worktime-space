# Identity of Time and Working Time
## Normative Definition of Time in ODWS

This document **normatively defines the identity of time and working time**
within the Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS).

Its purpose is to:
- prevent ownership or manipulation of time,
- prohibit semantic fragmentation of reality,
- clearly separate physical time from its interpretation.

This document is **normative**.

It applies in conjunction with:
- *ODWS Documentation Layers*
- *ODWS-CE Core – Normative Definition*
- *Identity of the Driver*
- *Identity of the Employer*
- *Identity of the Means*
- *ODWS Terminology Boundary*

## 1. Time as Physical Reality

Normatively:

- time is a **physical, continuous dimension**
- time exists **independently of humans, systems, or contracts**
- time cannot be:
  - created,
  - destroyed,
  - paused,
  - owned

Time is **not an administrative construct**.

---

## 2. Prohibition of Time Ownership

The following claims are **normatively prohibited** in ODWS:

- **time ≠ employer property**
- **time ≠ payroll unit**
- **time ≠ legal entitlement**
- **time ≠ system-generated artifact**

No entity:
- employer,
- authority,
- system,
- contract

may claim ownership of time.

---

## 3. Working Time as Interpreted Reality

Normatively:

- working time is **not a type of time**
- working time is an **interpretation of time**
- interpretation is applied **after reality exists**

Therefore:

- time exists first,
- interpretation follows,
- payroll and legal meaning are downstream.

---

## 4. Single Reality Timeline

Normatively:

- there exists **one continuous timeline**
- this timeline MUST NOT be fragmented
- no part of time may be removed or ignored

A driver:
- is always in time,
- is always in exactly one real state,
- never exits the timeline.

---

## 5. Prohibition of Time Fragmentation

The following practices are **normatively prohibited**:

- selective exclusion of time intervals
- splitting time based on contracts
- overlapping multiple working times
- parallel classification of the same time

Time:
- may be interpreted differently,
- MUST NOT be duplicated or erased.

---

## 6. Breaks and Rest as Time, Not Exceptions

Normatively:

- breaks are **part of time**
- rest is **part of time**
- no time interval is “non-time”

Breaks and rest:
- are real states,
- exist on the same timeline,
- MUST NOT be removed for convenience.

---

## 7. Time ≠ Recording

Normatively:

- recording does not create time
- absence of recording does not remove time
- delayed recording does not alter time

Therefore:

- missing records ≠ missing time
- technical failure ≠ temporal void

---

## 8. Relation to ODWS-CE Core

The ODWS-CE core:

- preserves a **continuous timeline**
- does not own, judge, or split time
- accepts delayed and manual records
- protects time from interpretation pressure

The core provides **time as reality**, not as entitlement.

---

## 9. Normative Summary

In ODWS:

- time is physical and continuous
- time cannot be owned or altered
- working time is interpretation, not reality
- reality precedes contracts and payroll
- systems must adapt to time, not redefine it

If an interpretation conflicts with time,
**the interpretation is wrong — not time**.
