# Documentation Translations (Normative Definition)

This document normatively describes the reality of documentation translations
within the **Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS)**.

It does not prescribe tools, workflows, or enforcement.
It defines **what translations are, and what they are not**.

---

## 1. Authoritative language

The authoritative ODWS documentation is written in **English**
and located in `docs/en/`.

All other language versions are:
- derived
- secondary
- non-authoritative

---

## 2. Relationship to the original

A translation never inherits the authority of the original.

In case of conflict,
the English original **always prevails**.

---

## 3. Purpose of translations

Translations exist to:
- improve accessibility
- support understanding
- enable discussion across languages

---

## 4. What translations are not

Translations are not:
- normative sources
- legal references
- rule-defining documents
- interpretative authorities

---

## 5. Nature of translated documents

Translated documents are:
- informational
- explanatory
- assistive

They are not part of the normative layer,
regardless of their quality.

---

## 6. Origin of translations

A translation may be:
- machine-generated
- human-edited
- hybrid
- partially corrected

Its form does not change its status.

---

## 7. Errors and deviations

Errors and semantic deviations:
- are expected
- are not system failures
- are not violations of ODWS principles

They are inherent to translation.

---

## 8. Responsibility

Responsibility for a translation lies with:
- the maintaining individual or team

ODWS does not assume:
- correctness
- completeness
- semantic equivalence

---

## 9. Automation

Translation automation may exist
but always serves a **supporting role**.

Automation:
- does not define correctness
- does not replace human judgment
- holds no authority

---

## 10. Human edits

Human edits are:
- allowed
- expected
- legitimate

There is no requirement to:
- preserve machine output
- match automated translations

---

## 11. Separation of concerns

ODWS strictly separates:
- normative definition (English documents)
- translations as communication aids
- implementation behavior
- organizational responsibility

This separation is intentional.

---

## 12. Reality summary

In ODWS:

- reality is defined by English text
- translations describe reality
- tools assist humans
- responsibility remains human

If a translation is wrong,
the system remains correct.
