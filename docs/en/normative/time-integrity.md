# Integrity of Working Time, Rest Time, and Vacation
## Normative Definition of Time Reality within ODWS

This document establishes the fundamental normative rules
for preserving the **integrity of human time**
within the Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS).

Its purpose is to protect the reality of work time,
rest time, and vacation time
from overlap, administrative constructs,
and accounting or interpretative shortcuts.

This document is **not**:
- a payroll policy,
- an accounting methodology,
- a legal interpretation.

ODWS defines reality here.
Interpretation and application may follow only afterward.

## 0. Time as a Physical and Human Reality

Human time:
- flows in one direction only,
- is continuous,
- is not parallel,
- cannot exist in overlapping layers.

A human being cannot be:
- at work and at rest at the same time,
- at work and on vacation at the same time,
- at rest and on vacation at the same time.

Any model that allows such overlap
denies the physical and human reality of time.

---

## 1. Fundamental Time States in ODWS

ODWS distinguishes the following **fundamental time states**:

- **working time**
- **rest time**
- **vacation time**

These states:
- are **mutually exclusive**,
- exist within a single shared timeline,
- **always follow one another sequentially**.

---

## 2. Temporal Continuity

Working time, rest time, and vacation time:

- form a **continuous temporal sequence**,
- never exist “outside of time”,
- never exist in parallel.

Every moment in time MUST belong
to **exactly one** of these states.

There is no “time in between”.

---

## 3. Prohibition of Time Overlap

ODWS **explicitly prohibits** any temporal overlap between:

- working time and rest time,
- working time and vacation time,
- rest time and vacation time.

Such overlap would:

- negate the reality of performed work,
- undermine the meaning of rest,
- strip vacation of its purpose,
- destroy auditability,
- compromise safety and human well-being.

---

## 4. Consequences of Violating Time Integrity

Once time states are allowed to overlap:

- real fatigue cannot be determined,
- actual work duration becomes indeterminable,
- genuine rest cannot be identified,
- fictitious accounting constructs emerge,
- responsibility is shifted onto individuals.

Such systems fail not because of misuse,
but because their foundational definitions are flawed.

---

## 5. Separation from Payroll and Legal Interpretation

This document:

- does **not** determine how time is paid,
- does **not** determine legal qualification,
- does **not** determine accounting treatment.

It establishes only that time
**must first be recorded as reality**.

Any payroll, legal, or accounting decision
may be made **only on top of this foundation**,
never instead of it.

---

## 6. ODWS Position

ODWS adopts the following position:

- working time, rest time, and vacation time are real and singular,
- these states never overlap,
- reality precedes interpretation,
- safety and human dignity take precedence over administration.

This document establishes a stable and immutable foundation
upon which further models, computations, and systems may be built
without violating the reality of time.

## 7. Relationship to Other ODWS Documents

This document is normatively superior and linked to:

- `working-time-definition.md`
- `workday.md`
- `waiting-standby-and-other-work.md`
- `absence-and-non-availability.md`
- `human-context.md`

It serves as a **guardian of temporal integrity**
across the entire ODWS system.
