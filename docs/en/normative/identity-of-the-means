# Identity of the Means
## Normative Definition of Means of Movement in ODWS

This document **normatively defines the identity of the means**
used for movement or transport within the Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS).

Its purpose is to:
- prevent conflation of means with vehicles, devices, or legal categories,
- establish a stable reality-based model of movement,
- protect the ODWS-CE core from technical and administrative assumptions.

This document is **normative**.

It applies in conjunction with:
- *ODWS Documentation Layers*
- *ODWS-CE Core – Normative Definition*
- *Physical and Technical Limits of Recording Devices*
- *Identity of the Driver*
- *ODWS Terminology Boundary*

## 1. Means as a Reality Concept

Normatively:

- a **means** is a real carrier of movement or displacement
- a means exists **only in relation to real movement**
- a means is defined by **what happens in reality**, not by classification

The means is part of **reality**, not of interpretation.

---

## 2. Prohibition of Identity Substitution

The following substitutions are **normatively prohibited** in ODWS:

- **means ≠ vehicle**
- **means ≠ tachograph**
- **means ≠ technical configuration**
- **means ≠ legal transport category**
- **means ≠ employer or organization**
- **means ≠ system object or role**

Any system behavior relying on such substitution is **invalid in ODWS**.

---

## 3. Means ≠ Vehicle

Normatively:

- a vehicle is a **technical object**
- a means is a **reality role**
- a vehicle MAY be a means
- a means MAY exist without any vehicle

Therefore:

- movement does not require a vehicle
- absence of a vehicle does not negate movement
- vehicle identity MUST NOT be used as a proxy for means identity

---

## 4. Means ≠ Tachograph

Normatively:

- a tachograph is a **vehicle-bound recording device**
- a tachograph records **only within a specific technical configuration**
- a tachograph does not define the means

Therefore:

- a means may exist without any tachograph
- a tachograph may record only a subset of movement
- absence of tachograph data is **not absence of movement**

---

## 5. Change of Means Over Time

Normatively:

- the means MAY change over time
- changes of means are part of reality
- no continuity of means is assumed or required

Examples (non-exhaustive):
- transition between vehicles
- multimodal transport
- movement without any technical carrier
- temporary absence of any means

The ODWS-CE core:
- MUST allow changes of means
- MUST NOT enforce artificial continuity

---

## 6. Means Without Mechanical Transport

Normatively:

- a means MAY be non-mechanical
- a means MAY be purely human
- a means MAY be absent

Movement:
- on foot
- during transfers
- during waiting or escorting

is **valid reality** and MUST NOT be excluded.

---

## 7. Relation Between Driver and Means

Normatively:

- the driver is **not identical to the means**
- the driver MAY:
  - use a means,
  - accompany a means,
  - be temporarily without a means
- driver identity and means identity are **independent**

The ODWS-CE core:
- MUST track driver reality independently of means
- MUST allow driver continuity across changing means

---

## 8. Relation to ODWS-CE Core

The ODWS-CE core:

- accepts means as a **reality attribute**
- does not derive meaning from means type
- does not interpret legality or classification
- preserves movement continuity regardless of means

Means are **inputs**, not authorities.

---

## 9. Normative Summary

In ODWS:

- a means is a carrier of real movement
- means identity is not a technical or legal label
- means may change or be absent
- devices and vehicles do not define movement
- reality precedes classification

If a system assumes a means that did not exist,
**the system is wrong**.

If movement occurred without a means,
**ODWS preserves it**.
