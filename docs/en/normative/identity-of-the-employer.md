# Identity of the Employer
## Normative Definition of the Employer in ODWS

This document **normatively defines the identity of the employer**
within the Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS).

Its purpose is to:
- prevent conflation of employer identity with human reality,
- prohibit ownership claims over time or reality,
- establish clear separation between work reality and legal relationships.

This document is **normative**.

It applies in conjunction with:
- *ODWS Documentation Layers*
- *ODWS-CE Core – Normative Definition*
- *Identity of the Driver*
- *Identity of the Means*
- *Physical and Technical Limits of Recording Devices*
- *ODWS Terminology Boundary*

## 1. Employer as a Legal Entity

Normatively:

- an employer is a **legal or organizational entity**
- the employer exists **only within legal and administrative frameworks**
- the employer is **not a physical actor**
- the employer does not experience reality

The employer is **not a source of reality**.

---

## 2. Prohibition of Identity Substitution

The following substitutions are **normatively prohibited** in ODWS:

- **employer ≠ driver**
- **employer ≠ owner of time**
- **employer ≠ source of reality**
- **employer ≠ technical authority**
- **employer ≠ device or system**

Any system behavior relying on such substitution is **invalid in ODWS**.

---

## 3. Employer ≠ Driver

Normatively:

- a driver exists independently of any employer
- a driver may have:
  - one employer,
  - multiple employers,
  - no employer
- employer relationships may:
  - begin,
  - end,
  - overlap,
  - change over time

Driver reality:
- precedes employment,
- continues during employment,
- persists after employment.

The ODWS-CE core:
- MUST NOT derive driver identity from employer data
- MUST NOT split or merge driver reality based on contracts

---

## 4. Employer ≠ Owner of Time

Normatively:

- time is a **physical and universal dimension**
- time cannot be owned, transferred, or created
- employment does not grant ownership of time

An employer may:
- compensate time,
- account for time,
- interpret time legally,

but MUST NOT:
- redefine time,
- erase time,
- create fictional time.

---

## 5. Employer ≠ Source of Reality

Normatively:

- reality occurs independently of employer awareness
- reality does not require employer approval
- reality is not suspended by administrative gaps

Therefore:

- lack of employer records is **not lack of reality**
- lack of employer systems is **not lack of work**
- absence of payroll data is **not absence of activity**

---

## 6. Employer ≠ Technical Authority

Normatively:

- employers do not control technical reality
- employers do not extend device capabilities
- employers cannot override physical limits

Therefore:

- employer requirements MUST NOT assume:
  - constant device access,
  - real-time recording,
  - continuous vehicle presence

Any requirement violating physical or technical limits is **invalid in ODWS**.

---

## 7. Employer Data as Interpretation Layer Input

Normatively:

- employer identity is an **interpretative attribute**
- it belongs to:
  - legal interpretation,
  - payroll computation,
  - contractual evaluation

Employer data:
- MAY be attached to reality records,
- MUST NOT alter reality itself,
- MUST NOT fragment the timeline.

---

## 8. Relation to ODWS-CE Core

The ODWS-CE core:

- preserves a continuous human reality timeline
- does not assign ownership of time
- does not validate contracts
- does not arbitrate employer claims

The core provides **neutral reality** for:
- legal interpretation,
- payroll systems,
- audits.

---

## 9. Normative Summary

In ODWS:

- the employer is a legal construct, not a real actor
- the employer does not own time or reality
- driver reality exists independently of employment
- contracts interpret reality, they do not create it

If employer expectations conflict with reality,
**the expectations are wrong — not reality**.
