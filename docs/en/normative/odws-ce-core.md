# ODWS-CE Core – Normative Definition of the Technical Core

This document **normatively defines the technical core (core) of the ODWS-CE system**
(Open Driver Worktime Space – Compensation Engine).

The document:
- defines **what the core does and does not do**
- establishes **clear responsibility boundaries**
- describes **the transformation of reality into a deterministic structure**

It does **not** address:
- legal interpretation
- wages or payroll
- sanctions
- evaluation of human behavior

These areas are covered by **other documentation layers**.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Core

The ODWS-CE core exists to:

- transform **records of reality** into a unified, consistent timeline
- preserve a **deterministic and auditable data structure**
- provide a **stable foundation for subsequent computations**

The core:
- **does not interpret**
- **does not assess**
- **does not judge**

The core only **faithfully transforms reality into a computationally usable form**.

---

## 2. Fundamental Principles

Normatively, the following applies:

- at any real point in time, **exactly one real state exists**
- the timeline is **continuous and unbroken**
- aggregation of states is a result of **interpretation**, not reality
- technical devices (e.g. tachographs) are **signal sources**, not authorities

---

## 3. Step A – Acquisition of Raw Reality

### A.1 Sources of Reality

The primary input consists of **records of the driver’s reality**, in particular:

- data from the driver card in a tachograph (e.g. `.ddd` format)
- other technical records
- manual reality inputs provided by a human

The core **normatively accepts** that:

- no device captures reality completely
- manual input is a **legitimate part of reality**
- reality may be recorded **with delay**

### A.2 Position on Input Truthfulness

The core:
- **does not presume falsehood**
- **does not reject corrections**
- **does not assess intent**

Each record is treated as a **statement of reality** until replaced by a correction.

---

## 4. Step B – Event Normalization

Raw inputs are transformed into unified **events**.

Each event contains at minimum:
- a timestamp
- an event type
- a source identifier

Typical mode changes include:
- driving
- work
- other activity
- rest

The core:
- **does not alter the meaning of modes**
- only **normalizes them into a common representation**

---

## 5. Step C – Construction of the Reality Timeline

From normalized events, the core constructs:

- **a single continuous timeline**
- without gaps
- without overlaps

Normatively:
- all intervals marked as rest are part of the timeline
- no interval of reality is excluded or suppressed
- breaks are **states of reality**, not exceptions

The core:
- **does not remove breaks**
- **does not interrupt reality**

---

## 6. Step D – Deterministic Ordering

The timeline is:
- uniquely ordered
- deterministic
- reproducible

For identical input:
- the core must always produce **identical output structures**

---

## 7. Step E – Preservation of Spatial Context

The core accepts:
- coordinates
- countries
- locations entered via tachograph or other sources

Normatively:
- spatial data is not challenged at input time
- corrections are recorded as new facts
- spatial information is **part of reality**

---

## 8. Step F – Preparation for Future Computations

Although the core **does not calculate wages**, it normatively requires that:

The core must retain sufficient information for:
- working time computation
- subsistence allowance calculation
- entitlement assessment
- cost reimbursement evaluation (e.g. private vehicle use)
- auditability of computations

This includes:
- precise time
- exact event ordering
- spatial continuity

---

## 9. Step G – Core Input and Output

### Input:
- records of reality (technical and manual)
- without legal evaluation

### Output:
- a structured, deterministic timeline of reality
- suitable for further computation and interpretation layers

The core:
- **does not conclude with legal judgments**
- **opens space for subsequent layers**

---

## 10. Relationship to Other Documents

This document is **normative**.

Descriptive documents:
- describe real-world situations
- explain why the model is necessary
- document conflicts between reality and expectations

Interpretative documents:
- address legal interpretations
- national specificities
- differing regulatory regimes

Computational documents:
- define specific calculation algorithms

---

## 11. Normative Summary

The ODWS-CE core:
- transforms reality, not interpretation
- preserves time, space, and order
- is deterministic and auditable
- protects reality from authority and assumption

If something is not recorded,
the core **does not invent it**.

If something is recorded,
the core **does not question it**.
