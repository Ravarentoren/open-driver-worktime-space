# External Reference Artifacts in ODWS
*(Normative Definition)*

---

## 1. Fundamental Definition

An **external reference artifact** is any document, dataset, table, methodology,
spreadsheet, or informational resource that:

- originates outside of ODWS,
- is not authored, governed, or maintained by ODWS,
- is not versioned under ODWS rules,
- is not part of the ODWS normative corpus.

External reference artifacts exist independently of ODWS and retain their own
authorship, responsibility, and lifecycle.

---

## 2. Position Relative to ODWS

External reference artifacts are **always outside ODWS** and carry **no normative
authority** within it.

This means that an external reference artifact:

- does not define what is considered true in ODWS,
- does not grant legitimacy to recorded data,
- cannot modify, override, or reinterpret reality recorded in ODWS,
- cannot replace primary temporal or factual records.

ODWS remains authoritative **only** over what actually occurred, **when** it
occurred, and **in what context** it occurred.

---

## 3. Permitted Use

An external reference artifact may be used **only in a derived and subordinate role**,
including:

- as an input source,
- as a computational or orientation aid,
- as an interpretative or explanatory reference,
- as a jurisdiction-specific or localized dataset.

All such usage is strictly subordinate to ODWS data, rules, and recorded reality.

---

## 4. Normative Boundary (Binding Rule)

An external reference artifact **may be consulted**, but it **never determines**
what is true in ODWS.

Any mechanism, rule, or process that:

- retroactively alters recorded time,
- redistributes reality across calendar boundaries,
- replaces factual occurrence with computation or estimation,
- elevates reference data above recorded events,

**does not belong to the ODWS normative layer**.

---

## 5. Separation of Responsibility

**ODWS:**

- defines structure, semantics, and normative rules,
- preserves temporal and factual integrity,
- protects recorded reality from reinterpretation.

**External reference artifacts:**

- may provide calculations, interpretations, or guidance,
- carry their own responsibility for correctness and validity,
- remain fully outside ODWS normative authority.

---

## 6. Core Principle

**Reference data must never redefine normative reality.**

This principle is binding for:

- implementations,
- computations,
- exports,
- interpretations,
- administrative processes,
- and human interventions applied to ODWS data.

---

## 7. Reality and Authority

🌍 **ODWS can never stand above reality.**

Truth carries authority by its own existence.  
Reality does not require sovereignty, validation, or permission.

- ODWS does **not** define truth.
- ODWS does **not** legitimize reality.

ODWS exists solely to:

- 📝 record what actually occurred,
- 🕒 preserve factual and temporal integrity,
- 🛡️ prevent reality from being replaced by computation,
  interpretation, or administrative constructs.
