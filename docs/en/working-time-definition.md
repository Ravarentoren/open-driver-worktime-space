# Definition of Working Time of a Professional Driver
## Normative Definition within ODWS

This document establishes the **fundamental definition of working time**
in the context of professional road transport
as understood within the Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS).

The purpose of this document is not to perform calculations,
resolve payroll matters, or provide legal interpretation,
but to **clearly and consistently define the reality of work**
on which further systems and models may be built.

---

## 0. Purpose and Scope

This document:

- defines professional driver working time within ODWS,
- separates work reality from methods of recording,
- establishes a normative foundation for further ODWS models.

This document:

- **is not a computational model**,
- **is not a payroll methodology**,
- **is not an accounting classification**,
- **is not a legal interpretation**.

ODWS defines reality.
Interpretation and application may follow only afterward.

## 1. Why ODWS Defines Working Time

In professional transport, a long-standing conflict exists between:

- the reality of performed work,
- the technical method of its recording,
- accounting and payroll interpretations.

These layers are frequently mixed in practice,
leading to ambiguity, disputes, and distortion of reality.

ODWS exists to:

- name this conflict,
- separate the individual layers,
- prevent their conflation.

Without a clear definition of working time,
no further entitlements, computations, or systems
can be addressed transparently.

## 2. Fundamental Definition of Working Time in ODWS

**ODWS adopts the following definition:**

> **The working time of a professional driver is the continuous sum of all activities

> performed between two daily rest periods.**

**A change in the type of activity:**

- **does not interrupt work,**
- **does not reduce its value,**
- **does not transfer the driver into personal free time.**

**Work is understood in ODWS as a continuous reality,**
not as a collection of administrative or technical labels.

This definition is **normative** for all ODWS models.

---

## 3. Working Time and Regulation (EC) 561/2006

Regulation (EC) 561/2006:

- regulates road safety,
- establishes limits for driving, breaks, and rest,
- serves the prevention of fatigue.

ODWS considers Regulation 561 to be:

- a **safety framework**,
- a **control mechanism**,

not a definition of the value or scope of performed work.

The categories used in Regulation 561
and recorded by tachographs
are technical and regulatory instruments,
not a description of work reality itself.

---

## 4. Recording Categories vs. Work Reality

Digital tachographs distinguish, among others:

- driving,
- other work,
- availability (standby),
- rest.

These categories:

- serve technical recording purposes,
- originate from historical and technical constraints,
- do not represent a value-based division of work.

ODWS:

- respects these categories as **signals**,
- uses them as **input data**,

but **does not treat them as an authoritative description of work reality**.

---

## 5. Working Time vs. Shift Duration

Shift duration is understood in ODWS exclusively as:

- a safety control metric,
- a fatigue management tool,
- a regulatory limit.

Shift duration:

- does not define the amount of work performed,
- must not limit paid time,
- is not a payroll parameter.

Working time and shift duration
are two distinct layers
that must not be confused or merged.

---

## 6. What Working Time Is NOT

Working time in ODWS:

- is not an accounting construct,
- is not a payroll trick,
- is not a cost-optimization tool,
- is not a negotiation item.

ODWS describes **what was performed**,
not **how it is convenient to report it**.

---

## 7. ODWS Position

ODWS adopts the following position:

- the work of a professional driver is continuous and complex,
- technical records are not truth, but traces,
- safety takes precedence over administration,
- reality precedes interpretation.

By doing so, ODWS establishes a stable and neutral foundation
for further calculations, entitlements, and systems,
without prematurely determining them.

## 8. Relationship to Other ODWS Documents

This document is closely linked to:

- `workday.md`
- `operational-realities.md`
- `waiting-standby-and-other-work.md`
- `human-context.md`

It serves as a **normative foundation**,
not as a computational or payroll model.
