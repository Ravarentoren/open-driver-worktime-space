# Project Scope

This document defines the scope
of the Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS) project.

Its purpose is to clearly specify
what the project addresses
and, equally clearly, what it does not.

---

## 1. What the Project Covers

ODWS addresses the computation
and transparent description of:

- driver working time
- time included and excluded from work
- basic work-related entitlements
  derived from performed work time

The project focuses on:

- **real operational data**
- **deterministic computation**
- **offline-first usage**
- **auditable and reproducible results**

The system output always consists of:
- a computed result
- an explanation of how the result was obtained
- identification of the interpretative model used

---

## 2. What the Project Intentionally Does Not Cover

ODWS intentionally:

- does not replace legal advice
- is not an authoritative interpretation of law
- does not resolve disputes
- does not assume responsibility for final wage decisions
- does not replace accounting or payroll systems

The project:
- **computes**
- **does not enforce decisions**

---

## 3. First Stable Scope (Phase 1)

The first stable phase of the project is limited to:

- processing driver working time
- basic time categories (work, availability, rest)
- local data processing without cloud dependency
- reference outputs in machine-readable formats

This phase does NOT aim to provide:

- full payroll calculations
- accounting system integrations
- comprehensive legislative coverage
- automated communication with public authorities

---

## 4. Extension Principles

The project scope may be extended only by:

- explicit decision
- preservation of simplicity
- without breaking core determinism

Any extension MUST:
- be separable
- be optional
- not disrupt existing computations

ODWS explicitly includes
on-demand deterministic computation
as part of its normative scope.

Systems that only compute results
after legal or administrative finalization
are outside the scope of ODWS.
