# Integrity of Overtime Work and Compensatory Time
## Normative Protection of Work Reality within ODWS

This document establishes fundamental normative rules
for the handling of overtime work and its forms of settlement
within the Open Driver Worktime Space (ODWS).

Its purpose is to protect:
- the reality of performed work time,
- the temporal and financial freedom of the employee,
- the logic of human labor in time.

This document is **not**:
- a payroll regulation,
- an accounting methodology,
- a collective agreement,
- a legal interpretation of any specific state.

ODWS defines the reality of work here.
The method of settlement may follow only afterward.

---

## 0. Fundamental Premise

Work:
- takes place in real time,
- consumes human energy,
- creates value at the moment of its performance.

Once work has been performed,
it cannot be retroactively cancelled, postponed,
or replaced by fiction.

---

## 1. Overtime as a Fact, Not an Exception

Overtime work is:
- work performed beyond the agreed or **basic working time**,
- real time actually worked,
- an indisputable fact.

Overtime:
- is not an assumption,
- is not an employee error,
- is not a voluntary favor,
- is not an accounting construct.

It is work performed in time.

The **basic working time** in the European labor context
is standardly defined as **8 hours per day**.
Any exceptions may exist only on the basis
of an explicit contractual arrangement.

---

## 2. Creation of Entitlement

At the moment overtime work is performed:
- an employee entitlement arises,
- an employer obligation to address this entitlement arises.

The form of settlement:
- does not change the existence of the work,
- does not change the moment the entitlement arises.

There is no state in which performed work
creates no entitlement at all.

---

## 3. Compensatory Time as a Form of Settlement

Compensatory time is:
- one possible form of settling an entitlement,
- not a property of the work itself.

Compensatory time:
- does not negate the fact that work was performed,
- does not change the nature of overtime work,
- does not change its value in time.

---

## 4. Condition for the Existence of Compensatory Time

Compensatory time exists **only if**:
- it was explicitly and **in writing** agreed upon,
- the agreement is:
  - specific,
  - comprehensible,
  - freely entered into by both parties,
- the agreement existed before,
  or at the latest at the moment the work was performed.

Without such an agreement:
**compensatory time does not exist**.

It does not exist:
- implicitly,
- tacitly,
- by custom,
- by internal regulation without employee consent,
- by unilateral employer decision after the fact.

---

## 5. Prohibition of Retroactive Conversion of Work into Time Off

ODWS explicitly prohibits:
- retroactively converting performed work into compensatory time,
- replacing a financial entitlement with time without employee consent,
- using compensatory time as a tool
  to defer or eliminate wage payment.

Any attempt at such conversion:
- denies the reality of work,
- violates temporal integrity,
- transfers entrepreneurial risk onto the employee.

---

## 6. Overtime in Professional Transport

ODWS acknowledges that in professional transport:
- overtime is a structural phenomenon,
- it arises from planning, operations, and customer commitments,
- the employee has no real possibility to prevent its occurrence.

These facts:
- do not excuse non-settlement,
- do not transfer responsibility to the employee,
- do not reduce the value of performed work.

---

## 7. Financial Freedom of the Employee

Time-based compensation instead of financial compensation:
- limits the employee’s financial freedom,
- shifts decision-making about the value of work,
- transforms wages into a conditional future possibility.

Therefore, ODWS insists that:
**Any substitution of wages by time
must be a free choice of the employee,
never an obligation.**

---

## 8. Relationship to Other ODWS Documents

This document is normatively superior and linked to:
- `working-time-definition.md`
- `time-integrity.md`
- `workday.md`
- `absence-and-non-availability.md`

Together, they form a closed foundation protecting:
- the reality of work,
- the reality of time,
- the reality of human effort.

---

## 9. ODWS Position

ODWS adopts the following position:
- work is reality, not interpretation,
- entitlement arises from the performance of work,
- agreement must be real, not presumed,
- time and wages are not accounting variables,
- human labor is not an interest-free loan.

This document exists to ensure
that no further system layer
can deny these realities.
